This GitHub repository contains code to to my old website that was hosted in Texas Tech University servers. This was initially developed in PHP and needs to be converted into a static website.

The original aim of this website was to showcase my web development skills while looking for a full time position after completing my Masters in Computer Science from Texas Tech University.  I am using CircleCI to deploy this website. The develop branch is deployed to beta environment and master is deployed to production environment.
